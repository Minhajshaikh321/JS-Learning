<!-- Note: to do these exercises, create an HTML file (like 6a.html, 6b.html, ...)
6a. Create a variable called 'hour' and save the current hour of the day
(use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).
If hour is between 6 and 12, display 'Good morning!' in the console
If hour is between 13 and 17, display 'Good afternoon!' in the console
Otherwise, display 'Good night!' in the console -->
