<!-- 6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years
and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).
• Create a variable ‘age' and save a person's age inside.
• Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for a discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise,display 'No discount' in the console. Note: try to use the || operator in your solution.
•Try changing the ‘age' variable to display different messages. -->
